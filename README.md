### Description: 
#### <p>This project shows how to save a value, something I struggled with before. One saves a value to local storage.</p>

### Contributing:
#### <p>Benjamin Smith</p>

### Tests:

### Installation: 
#### <p> </p>

### Usage: 
#### <p>With the deployed application, one can set appointments. During each day (in military time), a person can randomly use this app to type something in the box (it is best to click the left-ish side of the desired time block), click save, and it will be there to remind a person of what they need to do when that time comes. Future times are in green and past times (unless the job is for tomorrow) are in red.</p>
